There's something wrong with this code. In fact there are quite a lot of things wrong it, your job is to fix the problems and turn the project into clean modern java code.

You can change pretty much anything and everything about how the code is designed and implemented (including the java version), as long as it fulfills the same function (you'll have to determine what that function is from the code itself). So feel free to change method signatures, add dependencies, delete things or whatever else you think makes sense.

It is also permissible to make sensible changes to the behaviour, as long as you state how the behaviour has been changed and why. If you change the behaviour in some way but do not state that this has happened(and why) your entry will be marked down.
